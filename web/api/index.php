/* 
 * Use this to enable device detection in other services on your campus. They can send their user agent strings
 * to this script for classification. That way you only have to use one source for all your classification needs.
 * Ok, I'm tired and this is a lame write-up but hopefully it's fairly clear...
 *
 * To use:
 *
 *   - just send the user agent string you want to classify to:
 *
 *      http://m.institution.edu/api/?ua=user+agent+string
 *
 * NOTE: the user agent string must be url encoded.
 * 
 * This will return a JSON object with the following info:
 *
 *   - device name + any special version info (e.g. android22)
 *   - the name of the templates it'd be shown in mobile web osp (e.g. webkit)
 *   - true or false for if it's a computer, an android device, an ios device, an iphone, or an ipod
 *
