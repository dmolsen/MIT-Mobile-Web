The Mobile Web Project was initially developed during the summer of 2009 and is a fork of the original v0.9 release of the MIT Mobile Web project that can still be found on SourceForge. The project was updated in May 2010. It is a product designed to make it easier for higher education institutions to deliver mobile-optimized information and services. It helps deliver task-based content like maps, events, and directory information optimized for device "families."
